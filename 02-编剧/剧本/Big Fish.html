GUEST ROOM - DAY</span></h3><p><span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_750">Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed.  Although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared.  The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_752">There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_754">Coming up to the bed --</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4 class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_756">WILL</h4><p class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_757">Dad?</p></div> <p><span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_759">Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.  He tries to say something, but no words come out.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_761">He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.  Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_763">Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself.  A very long, tense beat.  Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.  </span>

I'll tell her you drank the whole thing.  Everyone wins.</p></div> <p><span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_795">A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes.  Fine.

It's too confining.  And this, here.  Being stuck in bed.  Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.</p></div> <p><span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_893">He smiles at his joke.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4 class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_895">WILL</h4><p class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_896">I thought you weren't dying.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4 class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_898">EDWARD</h4><p class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_899">I said this isn't how I go.

His voice is high and thin, but he gives it his all.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_929">Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what's wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.</span>

<span class="haseditorline" id="sourceline_931">He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He's starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.</span>

So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.
