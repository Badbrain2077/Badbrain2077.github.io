# Just do itÔºÅ

[Do it.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16x411q71u?p=3) 

Just do it. 

Dont let your dreams be dreams. 

Yesterday you said tomorrow. 

So just do it. 

Make your dreams come true. 

Just do it. 

Some people dream success while you are gonna wake up and work hard at it. 

Nothing is impossible. 

You should get to the point where anyone else would quit and you are not gonna stop there. 

No, what are you waiting for. 

Do it. 

Just do it. 

Yes you can.

Just do it. 

If you are tired of starting over, stop giving up.
